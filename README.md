# Federated_Learning_UAV

In the first step of the algorithm. the UAVs collaborate to build a model of the outage probability in the sky. For instance, in what follows, I presented the true location of the Base Stations and the outage model learned by the UAV agents. For this purpose, we use Federated Learning.
